      JavaServer Pages (JSP) is a technology created by Sun Microsystems 
      and closely tied to servlets.  As with servlets, Sun releases a JSP 
      specification, and third party vendors compete on their implementation 
      of that standard.  Being released by Sun puts JSPs in a very privileged 
      position, and had JSP solved a sufficient number of user problems it 
      would probably have won the market before there were any other viable 
      entries.  As is, a surprising number of users are disenchanted with JSP 
      and alternatives are gaining popularity.

      Tea is a newly open sourced product from the Walt Disney Internet Group,
      created internally over the years to solve their tremendous web production
      needs for sites such as ESPN.com.  It's similar to JSP although it avoids 
      many of JSPs problems, and already has terrific tools support.

      The Element Construction Set (ECS) package from the Java Apache Project
      is a set of classes modeled after the htmlKona product from WebLogic 
      (now BEA Systems).  ECS has many limitations, but it solves a certain 
      class of problems.

      XMLC makes use of XML to get nearly all the power of ECS without many of
      its limitations.  It was created by Lutris as part of their Open Source 
      Enhydra Application Server, and can be used as a separate component.
